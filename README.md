# AES-GCM-128---Encryption-using-python-2.7.12
Python 2.7.12 Implementation of AES-GCM Encryption algorithm, 128 bit according to NIST - Galois/Counter Mode, D. McGrew, J. Viega  (Revised specifcation posted June 2, 2005)

Strictly follow the guideline http://csrc.nist.gov/groups/ST/toolkit/BCM/documents/proposedmodes/gcm/gcm-revised-spec.pdf for the implementation.
It is open source project, develope for challeging my own logical and programming skills. All feedbacks, comments and reviews will be appreciated, please reach me through: darji@uwindsor.ca or savanddarji@gmail.com .

The code follows the same convention of input and output with the same name given in guideline of NIST. So please refer test vectors, the last part of the guideline for checking the code. The code will work for AES 128 bit test vectors, test case 1 through 6.

Anyone can access the code of decryption algorithm through: https://github.com/savanddarji/AES-GCM-128---Decryption-using-python-2.7.12
